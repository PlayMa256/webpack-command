- docs: writing commands
- docs: `webpack file.js file2.js` input must be existing file/directory, `entry: { cli: [ ... ]}`
- docs: `webpack --entry file --entry file2`
- docs: `webpack --entry.name file --entry.name file2`
- docs: `--resolve-alias.jquery jquery.plugin`
- docs: `--resolve-loader-alias.catalog catalog/lib/loader`
- docs: --entry overridden by default : https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/pull/358
